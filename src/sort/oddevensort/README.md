# OddEvenSort

This is basically a variation of bubble-sort. This algorithm is divided into two phases- Odd and Even Phase. The algorithm runs until the array elements are sorted and in each iteration two phases occurs- Odd and Even Phases.

In the odd phase, we perform a bubble sort on odd indexed elements and in the even phase, we perform a bubble sort on even indexed elements.
