# 234 Tree

A 2-3-4 Tree is a multiway search tree. It’s a self-balancing tree; it’s always perfectly balanced with every leaf node at equal distance from the root node.

Other than the leaf node, every node can be one of three types:

1. 2-Node has two child nodes and one data element
2. 3-Node has three child nodes and two data elements
3. 4-Node has four child nodes and three data elements
