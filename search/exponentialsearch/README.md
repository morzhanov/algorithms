# Exponential search

The name of this searching algorithm may be misleading as it works in O(Log n) time. The name comes from the way it searches an element.

Given a sorted array, and an element x to be
searched, find position of x in the array.

Input:  arr[] = {10, 20, 40, 45, 55}

x = 45

Output: Element found at index 3

Input:  arr[] = {10, 15, 25, 45, 55}

x = 15

Output: Element found at index 1
