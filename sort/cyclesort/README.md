# CycleSort

Cycle sort is an in-place sorting Algorithm, unstable sorting algorithm, a comparison sort that is theoretically optimal in terms of the total number of writes to the original array.

- It is optimal in terms of number of memory writes. It minimizes the number of memory writes to sort (Each value is either written zero times, if itâ€™s already in its correct position, or written one time to its correct position.)
- It is based on the idea that array to be sorted can be divided into cycles. Cycles can be visualized as a graph. We have n nodes and an edge directed from node i to node j if the element at i-th index must be present at j-th index in the sorted array.  Cycle in arr[] = {2, 4, 5, 1, 3}

```bash
 arr[] = {10, 5, 2, 3}
 index =  0   1   2   3
cycle_start = 0 
item = 10 = arr[0]

Find position where we put the item  
pos = cycle_start
i=pos+1
while(i<n)
if (arr[i] < item)  
    pos++;

We put 10 at arr[3] and change item to 
old value of arr[3].
arr[] = {10, 5, 2, 10} 
item = 3 

Again rotate rest cycle that start with index '0' 
Find position where we put the item = 3 
we swap item with element at arr[1] now 
arr[] = {10, 3, 2, 10} 
item = 5

Again rotate rest cycle that start with index '0' and item = 5 
we swap item with element at arr[2].
arr[] = {10, 3, 5, 10 } 
item = 2

Again rotate rest cycle that start with index '0' and item = 2
arr[] = {2, 3,  5, 10}  

Above is one iteration for cycle_stat = 0.
Repeat above steps for cycle_start = 1, 2, ..n-2
```
