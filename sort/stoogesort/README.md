# StoogeSort

The Stooge sort is a recursive sorting algorithm. It is defined as below (for ascending order sorting).

```bash
Step 1 : If value at index 0 is greater than
         value at last index, swap them.
Step 2:  Recursively, 
       a) Stooge sort the initial 2/3rd of the array.
       b) Stooge sort the last 2/3rd of the array.
       c) Stooge sort the initial 2/3rd again to confirm.
```
